  <p>See console for output.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I can't figure out why i get an 'undefined' returned to me at the
      end of the showCollection function. This shows up in the console log
      referencing line 51.</li>
    <li>Edit - figure this out - kind of. There seems to be some intersting
      things happening when you console.log a function that has console.logs
      inside of. I just removed the console.log around the showCollection and the
      undefined went away. </li>
    <li>I would love to dig in more around the more technical side of returns
      and what the computer is thinking / doing as its going through the arguments
    </li>
  </ul>
